## Introduction

The CPU Scheduling Visualizer allows you to explore various CPU scheduling algorithms with a **dynamic interface**, **real-time visualization**, and **interactive controls** to better understand how different algorithms manage process scheduling.

## Features

- ðŸŒŸ **Real-Time Visualization**: Observe the scheduling process of algorithms like FCFS, SJF, RR, and Priority Scheduling.
- ðŸ”„ **Interactive Controls**: Adjust parameters and see how different settings affect scheduling.
- ðŸ•’ **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare the performance of different algorithms side by side.
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization of Gantt Charts**: See how processes are scheduled over time with Gantt charts.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Detailed Metrics**: View metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
